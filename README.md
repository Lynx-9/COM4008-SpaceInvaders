This will detail what we need to add to the wiki when we can learn how to write a wiki 

 
Hadrian wrote the code for the invaders, and the invaders will increase their speed with each death
• Requirement: The full invaders array should include the three types of aliens. These should move
from side to side, and fire at the player at random. Their speed of movement should increase as the
invaders are reduced in number (from being shot).

Jack has covered the requirements for the Player, allowing the player to move smoothly and shoot while moving 
• Requirement: The defender (player) should be able to shoot multiple bullets continuously.
Implement collision detection so that invaders are destroyed when successfully shot by the player,
and that the player loses a life and respawns (until run out of lives) when shot by an invader.

Georgina has covered the requirements for obstacles/shields
• Requirement: The four green barriers should diminish every time they are shot by both the invaders
and the defender/player.
